1. Single quotes: 'This is in single quotes'
2. Double quotes: "This is in double quotes"
3. Nested quotes: "This has 'single quotes' inside double quotes"
4. Code with quotes: `const message = "Hello, world!";`

## Multiple Blank Lines Test



This text has multiple blank lines above it.

## Code Blocks

def test_function():
    print("This string has quotes")
    return "Another string with quotes"
```

## ChatGPT Style Format

**User:**

Can you explain what "JSON" stands for and why it's important?

**ChatGPT:**

JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation". It's important because:

1. It's a lightweight data interchange format
2. It's easy for humans to read and write
3. It's easy for machines to parse and generate
4. It's language independent

Here's an example of JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false,
  "courses": ["Math", "Science", "History"]
}
```
