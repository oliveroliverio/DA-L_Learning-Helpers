This application should be modular in design in terms of the code base.  I'd like to be able to add, remove, update tools as I see fit.  This application will simply serve as a wrapper for all these tools.  Here's an example tool written in python that will take an image from the clipboard, send it to OpenAI API to convert that image into markdown.  \n\n`img2markdown.py`\n\n```\npython\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport base64\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport subprocess\nimport tempfile\nimport argparse\nimport json\nimport pyperclip\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Available models with vision capabilities\nVISION_MODELS = [\n    \"gpt-4o\",\n    \"gpt-4-turbo\",\n    \"gpt-4-vision-preview\",\n    \"gpt-4\"\n]\n\n# Initialize OpenAI client\napi_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\nif not api_key:\n    print(\"Error: OPENAI_API_KEY not found in environment variables.\")\n    print(\"Please make sure you have a .env file with your OpenAI API key:\")\n    print(\"OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\nclient = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)\n\ndef get_image_from_clipboard():\n    \"\"\"Get image from clipboard and convert to bytes.\"\"\"\n    # Create a temporary file to save the clipboard image\n    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.png', delete=False) as temp_file:\n        temp_path = temp_file.name\n    \n    # Use macOS's pngpaste utility to get clipboard contents\n    print(\"Getting image from clipboard using pngpaste...\")\n    result = subprocess.run(\n        ['pngpaste', temp_path],\n        capture_output=True,\n        text=True,\n        check=False\n    )\n    \n    if result.returncode != 0:\n        print(\"Error capturing clipboard content.\")\n        print(\"Make sure you have pngpaste installed: brew install pngpaste\")\n        print(\"Also ensure you have an image copied to your clipboard.\")\n        os.unlink(temp_path)\n        return None\n    \n    # Check if the file exists and has content\n    if not os.path.exists(temp_path) or os.path.getsize(temp_path) == 0:\n        print(\"No image found in clipboard.\")\n        print(\"Please copy an image to your clipboard and try again.\")\n        os.unlink(temp_path)\n        return None\n    \n    # Read the image file\n    try:\n        with open(temp_path, 'rb') as img_file:\n            img_data = img_file.read()\n        \n        # Clean up the temporary file\n        os.unlink(temp_path)\n        return img_data\n    except IOError as e:\n        print(f\"Error reading image file: {e}\")\n        if os.path.exists(temp_path):\n            os.unlink(temp_path)\n        return None\n\ndef get_image_from_file(file_path):\n    \"\"\"Get image from a file and convert to bytes.\"\"\"\n    if not os.path.exists(file_path):\n        print(f\"Error: File not found: {file_path}\")\n        return None\n    \n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'rb') as img_file:\n            return img_file.read()\n    except IOError as e:\n        print(f\"Error reading image file: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef encode_image(image_bytes):\n    \"\"\"Encode image bytes to base64.\"\"\"\n    return base64.b64encode(image_bytes).decode('utf-8')\n\ndef try_models_in_sequence(base64_image, models, prompt, max_tokens=4096):\n    \"\"\"Try multiple models in sequence until one succeeds.\"\"\"\n    last_error = None\n    \n    for model in models:\n        try:\n            print(f\"Trying model: {model}...\")\n            response = client.chat.completions.create(\n                model=model,\n                messages=[\n                    {\n                        \"role\": \"user\",\n                        \"content\": [\n                            {\n                                \"type\": \"text\",\n                                \"text\": prompt\n                            },\n                            {\n                                \"type\": \"image_url\",\n                                \"image_url\": {\n                                    \"url\": f\"data:image/png;base64,{base64_image}\"\n                                }\n                            }\n                        ]\n                    }\n                ],\n                max_tokens=max_tokens\n            )\n            print(f\"Success with model: {model}\")\n            return response.choices[0].message.content, model\n        except Exception as e:\n            last_error = e\n            print(f\"Failed with model {model}: {e}\")\n            continue\n    \n    # If we get here, all models failed\n    raise Exception(f\"All models failed.

be a tool such that when I have this MacOS application open, depending on what time and day it is, I'd like these two characters displayed along with the Date and time.  \n\nMost importantly, I'd like to be able to update the code base of these tools, have unit tests ensuring proper functionality.  Or be able to add new tools to this MacOS app. \n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nIf so, create a development plan along with the project structure that's most suitable for this, detailed instructions on setting up my development environment (as if I was a professional software developer), as well as external resources that point me to \"best practices\" in software development of this kind of application.\n```\n\n---\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nThis sounds like a powerful and extensible app idea. Before I create the development plan and project structure, could you please clarify a few things?\n\n1. **GUI Framework**: Do you have a preferred GUI framework for MacOS? For example, Swift (using SwiftUI/AppKit), Python (Tkinter/PyQt/PySide), or Electron (using JavaScript/Node.js)?\n2. **Tool Types**: Will your tools always be local scripts (like `.py`, `.sh`, `.js`), or might some run remotely (via API or remote servers)?\n3. **Tool Interface**: Do all tools follow a command-line interface, or do some tools have their own GUI/UI?\n4. **Application Distribution**: Do you plan to distribute this app (e.g., via DMG or App Store) or will it remain personal?\n5. **Security Practices**: Are you interested in implementing keychain integration or other secure storage for API keys, or possibly managing sensitive keys through a local server or encrypted storage?\n\nLet me know your preferences so I can tailor the plan accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\n1. Swift\n2. both.  some are local, others might run remotely.  Initially local, then I'll port to remote if I want them accessible 24/7\n3. Initially, all tools will follow command-line interface.  For simplicity's sake, the only GUI is the main MacOS app. \n4. It will remain personal for now\n5. I don't know about keychain integration, more info on that would be helpful.  I original planned on managing sensitive keys through a local server or encrypted storage.  Whatever is used professionally in industry setting, I'd like to learn the best practices of that\n\n---\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nAwesome, thanks for the details. I’ll put together a comprehensive development plan and project structure for building your modular MacOS Swift app (“Personal Toolbox”) that acts as a GUI wrapper for running local and remote command-line tools. I’ll also include setup instructions, best practices for modular development, secure key management (including using the MacOS Keychain), and relevant external resources.\nGive me a moment to gather everything.\n\n---\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\n# Personal Toolbox Development Plan\n\n## Introduction\n\n**Personal Toolbox** is a modular macOS application (built in Swift, using SwiftUI for UI) designed as a GUI wrapper to launch various personal tools and scripts. The app provides a simple button-based interface to trigger different scripts/programs (in Python, Shell, JavaScript, etc.) from one convenient window. It is intended for personal use (no App Store distribution), which means we can leverage unrestricted macOS capabilities (like running external processes) without sandbox limitations. The goal is to design a clean, scalable architecture so that new tools can be added, updated, or removed with minimal effort. Initial tools include an **Image to Markdown** converter (`img2markdown.py`) and a **Day/Time Character Display** tool. The plan covers the overall architecture, module structure, sample tool integration, secure credential handling, development environment setup, and references to relevant resources.\n\n## Architecture and Modular Design\n\n**Clean, Scalable Architecture:** We will structure the app into clearly separated components so each tool is self-contained. The SwiftUI app will serve as the front-end, and each tool will be a module that the app can invoke as an external process or internal function. This modularization (breaking the project into smaller components) makes the app more manageable and extensible​[nimblehq.co](https://nimblehq.co/blog/modern-approach-modularize-ios-swiftui-spm#:~:text=Why%20modularization). By isolating tools, developers can add or modify a tool without affecting others, and even test each module independently.\n**Module Per Tool:** Each tool lives in its own folder (or Swift package) within the project, containing all files related to that tool. For example:\n\n```\nPersonalToolbox/\n├── PersonalToolboxApp.swift        # SwiftUI App entry\n├── ContentView.swift              # Main SwiftUI view with buttons\n├── Tools/\n│   ├── Img2MarkdownTool/\n│   │   ├── img2markdown.py        # Tool script\n│   │   ├── config.json            # (Optional) tool config or metadata\n│   │   └── tests/                 # (Optional) unit tests for the script\n│   └── DayTimeCharTool/\n│       ├── daychars.js           # Tool script (Node.js) or Swift code file\n│       └── ... (config/tests as needed)\n└── Resources/                     # App resources (if scripts are copied into bundle)\n```\n\nEach tool module can include a **configuration file** (e.g. JSON or plist) describing the tool (name, description, how to execute, etc.), the script/executable for the tool, and any unit tests or additional resources. The main app will read these tool definitions (potentially from a config file or by scanning the `Tools` directory) to dynamically populate the UI. This means adding a new tool could be as simple as dropping a new folder under `Tools/` and updating a config file or registry – no need to rewrite the core app logic.\n**Tool Definition and Registration:** We can define a `Tool` data model (struct or class) in Swift with properties like `name`, `launchCommand` (or script path plus interpreter), and possibly a flag for local vs. remote execution. At launch, the app can load an array of available tools (hard-coded, from a JSON, or discovered) and use it to build the interface. For scalability, a data-driven approach is preferred – for example, maintain a `tools.json` listing each tool’s name and script path. This way, tools can be added/removed by editing data rather than code. Internally, each tool can also have a dedicated Swift struct or View if it needs custom UI or handling, but all conforming to a common protocol (for instance, a `ToolProtocol` with a `run()` method). Using a protocol or common interface ensures the app can trigger any tool in a uniform way, whether it’s running a local script or making a network call.\n**Personal Use, Not App Store:** Since this app is for personal use only, we don’t need to adhere to App Store sandbox rules or provisioning. This simplifies development – for example, macOS App Sandbox (which would restrict launching subprocesses) can be kept **disabled**. We can freely use `Process` to execute CLI tools without special entitlements (App Sandbox usually forbids spawning arbitrary subprocesses). Not targeting the App Store also means we can use non-public APIs or bundle interpreters if needed, and we don’t have to worry about code signing beyond what’s needed to run on our Mac.\n\n## SwiftUI GUI Implementation\n\n**Button-Based Interface:** The UI will be a simple SwiftUI view that presents a list (or grid) of tools as buttons. Each button is labeled with the tool’s name (and possibly an icon or description) and triggers that tool’s execution. SwiftUI makes it easy to create a dynamic list from a collection of `Tool` models. For example, we might use a `List` or `VStack` to iterate over the tools array and create a `Button` for each:\n\n```\nForEach(tools) { tool in\n    Button(tool.name) {\n        runTool(tool)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that if the tools array is extended, the UI updates automatically to include the new buttons.\n**Launching Tools from UI:** The `runTool(_:)` action will invoke the corresponding script or program using the Foundation `Process` API. Because launching an external command can take time or produce output, we should handle it asynchronously to keep the UI responsive. In SwiftUI, this can be done by dispatching to a background thread (e.g. using `DispatchQueue.global().async`) and then capturing the output and updating the UI on the main thread​[stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70373933/swiftui-execute-script-on-click-and-return-output-on-view-window/70374091#:~:text=.onAppear%7B%20self.result%20%3D%20,). We may provide a text view or alert to show any output or status from the tool (for example, showing “Tool is running…” and then “Done” or output text).\n**Example (Pseudo-code for button action):**\n\n```\nfunc runTool(_ tool: Tool) {\n    // Show some loading state in the UI (optional)\n    DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {\n        let output = executeCommand(tool.launchCommand)\n        DispatchQueue.main.async {\n            self.lastOutput = output  // update SwiftUI state with result\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nEach tool might have a different way of execution – e.g. one might be a Python script, another a Node script or a built-in Swift function – but the app can abstract that. The `Tool.launchCommand` could be a full command string or a tuple of (executable, arguments). For instance, for a Python tool we might store `executable=\"/usr/bin/env\", args=[\"python3\", \"path/to/script.py\"]`. The `executeCommand()` function would create a `Process` with those parameters.\n**Using Process to Run CLI:** Swift’s `Process` class (formerly `NSTask`) allows spawning a subprocess. We will use it to run the tool scripts. A basic usage is: set the `executableURL` to the interpreter or shell, set the `arguments` (including the script path or any args), then call `run()` or `launch()`​[stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70373933/swiftui-execute-script-on-click-and-return-output-on-view-window/70374091#:~:text=let%20task%20%3D%20Process). For example, to run a Python script we could do:\n\n```\nlet task = Process()\ntask.executableURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: \"/usr/bin/python3\")\ntask.arguments = [scriptPath]\n```\n\nWe can capture output by attaching a `Pipe` to the task’s `standardOutput` before launching​[hackingwithswift.com](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-run-an-external-program-using-process#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20to%20read,depending%20on%20your%20needs). After the task exits, read the data from the pipe’s file handle and convert it to string​[hackingwithswift.com](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-run-an-external-program-using-process#:~:text=To%20read%20the%20output%20or,like%20this). This way, any text the script prints can be shown in our app. For interactive or long-running tools, we might even stream output live by reading from the pipe asynchronously, but for simplicity, reading after completion is fine for now.\n**Dynamic vs. Static UI:** In early versions, we might hard-code two buttons (for the two sample tools) to focus on functionality. As it matures, we can switch to dynamic loading of tool definitions as mentioned. SwiftUI easily supports either approach. The important aspect is keeping the UI logic decoupled from tool specifics – the UI shouldn’t need to know *how* a tool works, just that when clicked, it triggers something.\n\n## Local and Future Remote Execution\n\nCurrently, **Personal Toolbox** will support only local CLI tools – each button runs a script on the local machine. However, we want an architecture flexible enough to integrate remote tool execution in the future, such as calling a web API or executing code on a server.\nTo enable this, we design our `Tool` abstraction to not assume local execution. For example, we could add a property like `type` or `mode` for each tool: e.g. `\"local\"` vs `\"remote\"`. A remote tool might have an associated API endpoint instead of a script path. In the `runTool` logic, we can branch based on tool type: if local, run via `Process`; if remote, perform a network request (using URLSession or similar).\nAnother approach is to have different implementations of a `ToolProtocol`. For instance, a `LocalTool` class that knows how to spawn a process, and a `RemoteTool` class that knows how to call an API. Both conform to `ToolProtocol` (with a `run(completion:)` method). The UI code doesn’t care which it is – it just calls `selectedTool.run()` and maybe awaits a callback or Combine publisher for when it’s done. This polymorphic design means later adding a remote tool (like one that calls a cloud service) won’t require drastic changes to the app; we’d just add a new Tool implementation.\nWe should also consider output handling for remote calls (e.g. parsing JSON response vs. reading stdout) but we can normalize this by having each tool ultimately return a String or structured result that the UI can present.\nBy planning these abstractions now, we ensure the codebase can evolve beyond local scripts. For example, if we later create a tool that triggers a server-side heavy computation via REST API, we’d add a new `RemoteTool(endpointURL:)` and the UI would integrate it seamlessly, as it already treats tools generically.\n\n## Example Tool 1: Image to Markdown (`img2markdown.py`)\n\nOne sample module is **Img2MarkdownTool**, which contains a Python script `img2markdown.py`. This script’s function is: read an image from the clipboard, send it to the OpenAI API (presumably for image-to-text or captioning), and get a Markdown output (perhaps a description or an image link in Markdown format).\n**Connecting the App to `img2markdown.py`:** We will bundle this script with the app or ensure the app knows its path. For simplicity, include `img2markdown.py` in the application’s Resources (via Xcode). During build, Xcode can copy it into the app bundle (e.g. under `Resources/Tools/Img2MarkdownTool/`). The Swift code can retrieve the path using `Bundle.main.path(forResource: \"img2markdown\", ofType: \"py\", inDirectory: \"Tools/Img2MarkdownTool\")`. This path will be used when setting up the `Process` to run the script.\nThe button in SwiftUI labeled \"Image to Markdown\" will call something like:\n\n```\ntask.executableURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: \"/usr/bin/env\")    // using env to find python\ntask.arguments = [\"python3\", scriptPath]\n```\n\nWe use `/usr/bin/env python3` as the interpreter to be flexible in finding Python. Alternatively, we can specify a fixed path to Python (macOS 12+ may not ship Python by default, so the user might have installed it via Homebrew; using `env` picks it up from the PATH). The script might require certain Python packages (like `openai`). We should document these in a README or a requirements file in the tool’s folder. The developer should install the requirements (e.g. `pip install openai`) in their environment. Optionally, we could ship a virtual environment or use a tool like PyInstaller to bundle dependencies, but for personal use it might be overkill. It’s acceptable that the host system has the needed runtime and packages.\n**Clipboard Access:** The `img2markdown.py` will need to read an image from the clipboard. On macOS, one way to do this in Python is to use the **Pasteboard**. We might use a command-line utility via subprocess (like calling `pngpaste` if installed, or AppleScript to get clipboard data) inside the Python script. Another method is using the `pyobjc` library to interface with NSPasteboard, but that adds complexity. Since this is a personal script, it might already have a method to get the image (perhaps using `PIL` or similar on a file if the user manually saves the image). For our integration, we assume the script works on its own when run in Terminal. If any special permissions are needed (e.g. macOS might ask for permission to use the clipboard or accessibility APIs if using AppleScript), the user can grant them since it’s a personal app.\n**OpenAI API Call:** The script will call OpenAI’s API (likely the image-to-text or OCR capability). This requires an API key (which we discuss in the **Secure API Key Handling** section). The key should **not** be hardcoded in the script or app. We will provide it securely at runtime. The simplest approach: the Swift app retrieves the OpenAI API key from secure storage (e.g. Keychain) and sets it as an environment variable for the process, such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`. In Swift, you can do: `task.environment = [\"OPENAI_API_KEY\": apiKeyValue]`. The Python script can then read `OPENAI_API_KEY` from its environment (via `os.getenv`) and use it to authenticate with OpenAI. This way, the sensitive key is not passed via command-line arguments (where it could be visible in process list), and not stored in the script file.\nAfter the script completes, it will (by design) print out the resulting Markdown text. Our app captures this output from stdout, as described earlier, and can then do something with it. For example, we could display it in a TextView so the user sees the Markdown result and can copy it. We might even automatically put the result back into the clipboard (using NSPasteboard in Swift) for convenience, since the likely next step is the user pasting that Markdown somewhere. All of this logic can be contained in the Img2Markdown module or in the central handler after getting the output string.\n**Testing:** For this tool, unit testing could involve running `img2markdown.py` with a known image input and checking that the output matches expected Markdown (perhaps by simulating the clipboard content). Since it calls an external API, in tests we might want to mock the OpenAI API call (maybe by setting an env var to hit a mock server). However, for personal use, one might simply test it manually. Nonetheless, structuring the script to have a function that can be tested (separate from the clipboard I/O) would be beneficial. For example, having a function `image_to_markdown(image_data) -> str` that can be unit-tested with sample data, while the script’s main section handles reading clipboard and printing result.\n\n## Example Tool 2: Day/Time Characters Display\n\nThe second example tool displays certain characters or text based on the current day and time. Originally this was a Node.js API service; we want to repurpose it for local use (either as a CLI script or by embedding the logic).\n**Tool Description:** We’ll call this tool **DayTimeCharTool**. Perhaps it returns a unique symbol or message each day of the week and time of day (for example, different ASCII art or unicode character depending on the hour). As a local tool, we have two main options:\n\n* **Option A: Node.js Script.** We can write a Node script (e.g. `daychars.js`) that contains the logic (likely some date/time logic, maybe an array of characters indexed by weekday/hour). The script when run prints the resulting character(s) to stdout. We include this `daychars.js` in the tool’s folder. The Swift app will call it with Node. For instance: `task.executableURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: \"/usr/bin/env\")`, arguments `[\"node\", scriptPath]`. This requires that Node.js is installed on the system. Since this is a developer’s personal machine, installing Node (e.g. via Homebrew or Node Version Manager) is straightforward. We should document that dependency. If Node is not installed, that tool’s button could show an error; but other tools would remain functional. To avoid surprises, the development guide will note to have Node available if using this tool.\n* **Option B: Reimplement in Swift.** Because the logic might be simple (just based on the system clock), we could implement it directly in Swift within the app module. For example, when the \"Day/Time Character\" button is pressed, instead of launching an external process, the app can directly compute the result. This would eliminate the Node dependency. The design allows for this, since not all tools must be external scripts; a tool could also be an internal function. We would simply create a `Tool` entry that when run, executes a Swift closure rather than a process. Our architecture can handle that by either having a special case or by treating the Swift code as a local process without external files. For instance, we might decide that if `Tool.launchCommand` is nil but it has an `internalAction` closure, run that.\n\nUsing Option B trades modularity (the tool wouldn’t be language-agnostic) for simplicity (no external runtime needed). However, since the requirement emphasizes modular tools in various languages, we’ll proceed with Option A (Node script) to illustrate the heterogeneity.\n**Integration via Node:** Assuming `daychars.js` is in the bundle, the Swift code for the button will spawn a Node process similarly to the Python case. We might do:\n\n```\ntask.executableURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: \"/usr/bin/env\")\ntask.arguments = [\"node\", scriptPath]\n```\n\nWhen invoked, `daychars.js` will determine the current date/time (using JavaScript’s Date object) and choose what to output. It could simply `console.log()` the character or message. The app captures stdout and can display it in the UI or copy it. This tool likely doesn’t need any special input or config (just uses system time), so integration is straightforward.\n**Example Output:** If the Node API originally, say, returned a different emoji each hour, the local script can do the same. For instance, Monday morning might output \"☕\", Friday evening \"🎉\", etc. The specifics aren’t crucial for the plan; what matters is we have shown how a Node-based tool can plug in the same way as a Python tool.\n**Testing:** If using a Node script, we can write simple tests for it using a Node test framework or even just by invoking it with different mocked times. If the logic is extremely simple (like a lookup table), testing might be minimal. If embedded in Swift (Option B), then we can directly unit test the Swift function that produces the output given a date/time input.\nThis second tool demonstrates the app’s ability to handle multiple languages and even non-Python scripts. It also shows how one could migrate a service (originally running as a web API) to a local utility within the Personal Toolbox.\n\n## Secure API Key Handling\n\nOne critical aspect is managing the OpenAI API key (and any similar credentials) securely. We will **not** hardcode API keys in the app or scripts, and we want to avoid exposing them in plaintext. Below we evaluate several approaches and recommend a solution:\n\n* **Keychain Integration (Recommended):** On macOS, the Keychain is the secure storage system for sensitive data. Apple’s documentation notes that *“the keychain is the best place to store small secrets, like passwords and cryptographic keys.”*​[forums.developer.apple.com](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/120839#:~:text=Quoting%20the%20docs%3A%20,place%20to%20store%20small%20secrets) Storing the OpenAI API key in the user’s Keychain means it will be encrypted and protected by the OS (the user’s login credentials). We can store the key once (for example, the first time the user runs the tool, prompt them to input their API key, then save it to Keychain). Subsequent runs can retrieve it programmatically. In Swift, we use the Security framework (functions like `SecItemAdd`, `SecItemCopyMatching`) or a wrapper library (like KeychainAccess) to store/retrieve the key. Using Keychain is industry-standard for API secrets​[stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29571070#:~:text=The%20place%20to%20save%20keys,secrets%20is%20the%20App%20Keychain) – it keeps them out of the code and off disk in plaintext. The app can fetch the key at runtime and inject it into the environment or pass it to the script securely. **Recommendation:** This is the preferred method for our app, as it balances security with relative ease of use on a single machine.\n* **Local `.env` File:** A simpler but less secure method is to use a local configuration file (like `.env` or plist) that contains the API key. This file would not be checked into source control (listed in `.gitignore`) to avoid leaking the key. The app or script can load this file to get the key. For example, the Python script might use a library like `python-dotenv` to load a `.env` file in the user’s home directory containing `OPENAI_API_KEY=...`. Or the Swift app could read a config file from `~/.personal_toolbox_config`. The advantage is that it’s easy to set up and doesn’t require Keychain API coding. However, the key is stored in plaintext on the file system (albeit in the user’s protected home directory). If an unauthorized person accessed the machine or backup, the key could be exposed. For personal single-user usage, this risk might be acceptable, but it’s not ideal. A hybrid approach is to use Xcode’s Scheme Environment Variables during development – you can set an env var in the Run scheme with the API key so that it’s injected at runtime but never stored in code​[swiftlogic.io](https://swiftlogic.io/posts/xcode-environment-variables/#:~:text=Understanding%20Xcode%20Scheme%E2%80%99s%20Environment%20Variables). This avoids writing the key to disk in the app bundle or repo, and is a quick solution for development and testing (the environment variable can be accessed via `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment` in Swift).\n* **Encrypted Local Server:** This approach is more elaborate and typically not needed for a single-user desktop app. The idea would be to run a small local service (perhaps on `localhost`) that holds the API key (and possibly other secrets) and only provides them to the app on request, after some authentication. The local server could store the key encrypted on disk or require the user to enter a password to decrypt it. Essentially, this is like building a mini “vault” on the local machine. Industry-wise, rather than a local server, applications sometimes fetch secrets from a remote server or a cloud secret manager. But since our scenario is offline/personal, a local daemon would be analogous. Implementing this would require running a background process or daemon, managing encryption keys, and communication between the app and the daemon – which is overkill here. It could theoretically add security through obscurity (an attacker would need to figure out how to query the local server for the key), but if the app can get it, likely a determined attacker could as well. For most purposes, macOS Keychain already **is** a local secure service (the system’s) – it encrypts and controls access to secrets. Therefore, using Keychain is preferred over rolling our own local encryption server.\n* **Industry Standard Practices:** In professional environments, common strategies include not embedding API keys in apps at all. Instead, apps authenticate to a server and that server holds the real API keys to call third-party services. This way, even if the app is decompiled, the keys aren’t present. Another practice is to **obfuscate** keys if they must be in the app (e.g., splitting the key string and combining at runtime) – this only stops casual snooping, not a skilled attacker. Some developers use build-time configuration: for example, injecting keys via environment variables or config files that aren’t committed, as mentioned above, or using Apple’s **.xcconfig** files and Info.plist placeholders (but as one author noted, that still leaves them in the binary plain unless further protected​[dev.to](https://dev.to/msiatrak/securing-api-keys-in-swiftui-a-practical-guide-intro-3f91#:~:text=keys%20has%20become%20a%20paramount,plist)​[dev.to](https://dev.to/msiatrak/securing-api-keys-in-swiftui-a-practical-guide-intro-3f91#:~:text=traditional%20method%20of%20storing%20API,plist)). Advanced techniques include encrypting the keys and decrypting in memory with a runtime key, or leveraging hardware security (like the Secure Enclave) if available. But again, these are complex for diminishing returns in a personal app.\n\n**Chosen Method:** Use **macOS Keychain** to store the OpenAI API key, combined with passing it via environment variable to the script. This approach is both secure and convenient for a personal app. We’ll implement a small utility in Swift to save a key to Keychain (tagged with a service name like `\"com.myname.personaltoolbox\"` and account `\"OpenAIKey\"`). The first time `img2markdown` runs, the app could check Keychain for the key; if not found, prompt the user (via a secure input dialog) to enter it, then save it. Subsequent runs fetch it without prompting. This way the key is never hardcoded or logged. In documentation, we will caution never to hardcode API keys in the code or repository, echoing the standard advice that **“the place to save API secrets is the app Keychain”**​[stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29571070#:~:text=The%20place%20to%20save%20keys,secrets%20is%20the%20App%20Keychain).\n\n## Development Environment Setup Guide\n\nTo ensure professional developers (or your future self) can work on Personal Toolbox efficiently, we outline how to set up the development environment and handle integration of Python/Node tools and credentials.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* **Hardware/OS:** A Mac running a recent version of macOS (the project can target macOS 12.0+ to use SwiftUI comfortably). Ensure sufficient permissions to run apps from Xcode (no special requirements since no App Store sandbox).\n* **Xcode:** Install the latest Xcode (e.g. Xcode 14 or 15) which includes Swift 5+ and SwiftUI. Within Xcode, you may need to enable the \"Developer Mode\" on the Mac for faster debugging (Xcode usually prompts for this).\n* **Swift & SwiftUI Knowledge:** Familiarity with SwiftUI is assumed. If new to macOS app development with SwiftUI, see Apple’s tutorials on Creating a macOS app with SwiftUI for a primer.\n* **Python:** Install Python 3 if not already available. Modern macOS might have Python 3 via Xcode command line tools or none at all. We recommend installing via Homebrew (`brew install python`) to ensure `/usr/local/bin/python3` exists. Verify that running `python3` in Terminal works and that needed libraries (OpenAI, etc.) are installed. If using a virtual environment for Python, ensure the app’s `Process` calls use the correct interpreter path.\n* **Node.js:** Install Node.js if you plan to use the Node-based tool. Homebrew (`brew install node`) or the official installer can be used. Ensure the `node` command is in your PATH. (If you prefer not to use Node, you could disable or remove that tool module.)\n\n### Project Setup\n\n**Cloning and Opening:** Clone the repository (if using version control) and open `PersonalToolbox.xcodeproj` in Xcode. The project should already have the folder structure mentioned. If the Tools scripts are not yet present (perhaps kept out of repo for size or security reasons), place the provided tool scripts into the `Tools/` directories as documented.\n**Targets & Configuration:** The project has a single app target (PersonalToolbox). All tools’ resources (scripts, configs) should be included in the app bundle for easy access. Check **Build Phases** > **Copy Bundle Resources** – it should include `img2markdown.py`, `daychars.js`, etc. If not, add these files so they get copied into the app on build. This ensures at runtime `Bundle.main` can find them.\nBecause we are not distributing via App Store, code signing is only needed to run locally (Xcode uses a development certificate automatically). If any issues, set the team to your personal team in Signing & Capabilities.\nNo special entitlements are required since we aren’t sandboxing. In fact, ensure the app is not sandboxed (in the project settings, the “App Sandbox” capability should be off) to allow executing external scripts freely.\n**Environment Variables & Config:** We recommend not hardcoding secrets. Set the OpenAI API Key in Keychain as described. You can create a small test in `AppDelegate` (or the SwiftUI App struct) to store a dummy value to Keychain and ensure you can retrieve it. Alternatively, during development, you could temporarily use Xcode’s scheme to pass the API key: go to Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme > Run > Arguments, and add an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your value. This way, when running from Xcode, the key is available to the app (via `ProcessInfo`) and can be forwarded to the script without storing it on disk​[swiftlogic.io](https://swiftlogic.io/posts/xcode-environment-variables/#:~:text=Understanding%20Xcode%20Scheme%E2%80%99s%20Environment%20Variables). This is handy for initial testing. Just remember to remove it or use Keychain for long-term use.\nIf using a `.env` file approach, place the file in a known location (like project root or user’s home) and update the script to load it. But given our decision, the Keychain method means the app itself will handle providing the key so the scripts can remain clean.\n**Python/Node Integration:** In Xcode, ensure that the paths to the Python and Node executables are correctly referenced. The app when running may not inherit the full PATH of your shell. For example, if using `/usr/bin/env python3`, it will search a default PATH. If Python or Node are in `/usr/local/bin`, that is usually included, but if not, you might need to specify full paths. One trick: in the `Process` call, we can set `process.environment` to include a PATH variable (e.g., `PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin`). This ensures the subprocess can find `python3` and `node`. Alternatively, use absolute paths (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/python3`). It’s worth testing by running the built app outside Xcode to ensure it finds the interpreters.\n**Including Dependencies:** The Python script may depend on external packages (OpenAI). Since this is personal, you can rely on the global environment (i.e., if you installed `openai` via pip globally, the script will just work). For reproducibility, you might document the required packages in a `requirements.txt`. A developer setting up the project should run `pip install -r Tools/Img2MarkdownTool/requirements.txt`. Similarly, if the Node script had dependencies, include a `package.json` in its folder and have the developer run `npm install`. However, our Node tool likely has no dependencies beyond Node itself.\n\n### Running and Testing\n\n**Running the App:** Build and run the app from Xcode. A window should appear with the tool buttons. Clicking a button should execute the corresponding tool. Watch the Xcode debug console for any output or errors from the scripts (since we capture output, we might not automatically print it to console, but during development we could log it). The first run of \"Image to Markdown\" might prompt for an API key (depending on implementation). Ensure the OpenAI key is set before running, otherwise the script will likely error. You can handle errors by catching the Process termination status and capturing stderr.\n**Unit Tests:** The Xcode project can include a test target for the Swift code (testing the Tool launching logic, for instance). Run `Cmd+U` to execute any unit tests. Since much of the heavy logic is in external scripts, those can be tested separately:\n\n* For `img2markdown.py`, you might write a Python unittest (in the `tests/` subfolder) to test functions within it. Run those via command line (they won’t run in Xcode). This is more of a manual step.\n* For `daychars.js`, similarly, you could use a simple Node test or just test by running the script for different times.\n\nWhile these are not integrated into Xcode’s test suite, you can incorporate them into a CI workflow or a custom script. For example, you could add a build phase that runs `pytest` on the Tools tests and fails the build if they fail. This would require the developer’s machine (or CI runner) to have the necessary interpreters and packages installed, which should be noted.\n**Continuous Integration (CI):** If you use a CI service (like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, etc.), you can set up a macOS runner to build and test the app. Setting up CI for macOS projects is very doable​[rhonabwy.com](https://rhonabwy.com/2020/05/09/continuous-integration-with-github-actions-for-macos-and-ios-projects/#:~:text=Setting%20up%20CI%20for%20macOS,support%2C%20or%20connected%20the%20dots). For instance, GitHub Actions provides macOS runners where you can run Xcode builds and even run the CLI tools. In a CI script, you might:\n\n* Install brew packages (if needed for Python/Node).\n* Install Python packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).\n* Run Python/Node tests for the tools.\n* Build the Xcode project (`xcodebuild build` and `xcodebuild test` for Swift tests).\n* Optionally, archive the app or run any linter.\n\nFor code signing in CI (not needed unless you distribute), GitHub Actions has guides on installing signing certificates on macOS runners​[docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/deploying/installing-an-apple-certificate-on-macos-runners-for-xcode-development#:~:text=This%20guide%20shows%20you%20how,distributing%20it%20to%20test%20groups), but for personal use you can skip signing or use a self-signed dev ID.\n**Continuous Deployment:** Since this app isn’t for distribution, we don’t need TestFlight or App Store deployment. However, you might still want an easy way to install it on your other Macs. A straightforward way is to have CI produce a zip or `.dmg` of the app as an artifact. Then you can download and run it. Without App Store, you may need to right-click > Open to bypass Gatekeeper on first run (or sign it with your Developer ID if you want to avoid that).\n\n### Additional Development Tips\n\n* **Debugging Tools:** Use Xcode’s debugger to step through Swift code. For debugging the scripts, it might be easier to test them standalone in their environment. If a script isn’t working when launched from the app, print the output and error to see what happened. Common issues are missing PATH, missing permissions, or missing packages.\n* **Logging:** You can add logging in Swift (print statements or use OSLog) to trace execution. Also consider logging the command being executed for transparency. For example, log `\"Running: python3 img2markdown.py\"` so you know what’s happening.\n* **Extensibility:** If adding new tools, follow the established pattern. Create a new folder, add the script, update the config (or code) to include the new tool, and test launching it. Keep each tool’s logic self-contained.\n* **Mac App Specifics:** If any tool requires special macOS permissions (like accessing files, camera, etc.), you might need to add usage descriptions in the Info.plist or handle permission dialogs. For example, if a tool wanted to capture screen or read clipboard extensively, macOS might prompt. Just be aware and handle gracefully.\n\n## Further Resources\n\n* **macOS App Development (Swift/SwiftUI):** Apple’s official documentation and tutorials are the best starting point. For example, *Apple Developer SwiftUI Tutorials* demonstrates how to create a Mac app with SwiftUI and share code with iOS​[developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-a-macos-app#:~:text=Creating%20a%20macOS%20app%20%E2%80%94,in%20menu%20command). Additionally, the WWDC video *“Building a Great Mac App with SwiftUI”* provides guidance on Mac-specific UI components​[developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/building_a_great_mac_app_with_swiftui#:~:text=Building%20a%20Great%20Mac%20App,other%20popular%20user%20interface%20elements). These resources help in understanding SwiftUI structure, lifecycle on macOS, and integration with AppKit if needed.\n* **SwiftUI and Process Execution:** Paul Hudson’s article “How to run an external program using Process” is a concise guide on using `Process` in Swift​[hackingwithswift.com](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-run-an-external-program-using-process#:~:text=try%20task)​[hackingwithswift.com](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-run-an-external-program-using-process#:~:text=To%20read%20the%20output%20or,like%20this). It shows how to set up a task, launch it, and capture output with `Pipe`. Another resource is the StackOverflow Q&A on executing scripts from SwiftUI, which illustrates running a shell script on button click and updating the UI with output (using background threads to avoid blocking the UI)​[stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70373933/swiftui-execute-script-on-click-and-return-output-on-view-window/70374091#:~:text=.onAppear%7B%20self.result%20%3D%20,). These resources confirm that running external CLI tools from a SwiftUI Mac app is feasible and provide example code.\n* **Modular Codebase Design:** For an understanding of modular app structure in Swift, see \"Modularizing iOS Applications with SwiftUI and Swift Package Manager\"​[nimblehq.co](https://nimblehq.co/blog/modern-approach-modularize-ios-swiftui-spm#:~:text=Why%20modularization). Though iOS-focused, it discusses separating features into modules, which is analogous to our tool separation. The Nimble article highlights benefits like independent development and testing of modules. Also, consider the **The Modular Architecture (TMA)** guide by Tuist (an architecture approach for Apple apps) which promotes scalable module separation (useful if the project grows significantly).\n* **Secure Credential Storage:** Refer to Apple’s Security framework documentation on Keychain Services – specifically, *“Storing Keys in the Keychain”* which emphasizes that Keychain is ideal for small secrets​[forums.developer.apple.com](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/120839#:~:text=Quoting%20the%20docs%3A%20,place%20to%20store%20small%20secrets). The Stack Overflow thread \"Where to store API keys on Swift?\" has an accepted answer reinforcing that the Keychain is the proper place for API secrets in iOS/macOS apps​[stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29571070#:~:text=The%20place%20to%20save%20keys,secrets%20is%20the%20App%20Keychain). For a broader perspective, the Dev.to article *“Securing API Keys in SwiftUI: A Practical Guide”* by Mateusz Siatrak covers multiple methods (plist, Keychain, server fetch, obfuscation, etc.) and weighs their pros/cons​[dev.to](https://dev.to/msiatrak/securing-api-keys-in-swiftui-a-practical-guide-intro-3f91#:~:text=keys%20has%20become%20a%20paramount,plist)​[dev.to](https://dev.to/msiatrak/securing-api-keys-in-swiftui-a-practical-guide-intro-3f91#:~:text=,Retrieval%20and%20Keychain%20Storage). It's a great read to understand industry approaches to secret management.\n* **Testing and CI/CD for macOS Apps:** Apple’s Xcode documentation on testing covers how to write unit and UI tests for Mac apps (very similar to iOS). For CI/CD, the GitHub Actions official docs and the blog “Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions for macOS projects” provide insight on setting up workflows. It notes that setting up CI for Mac, while historically tricky, is now quite doable – typically building, running tests, and even code signing for distribution can be automated​[rhonabwy.com](https://rhonabwy.com/2020/05/09/continuous-integration-with-github-actions-for-macos-and-ios-projects/#:~:text=Setting%20up%20CI%20for%20macOS,support%2C%20or%20connected%20the%20dots). Tools like Fastlane can help with automating notarization or distribution if ever needed. For our purposes, focusing on automated testing is key: ensure that both Swift code and external scripts can be validated in an automated fashion. If using GitHub, the *Using secrets in GitHub Actions* guide​[docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/deploying/installing-an-apple-certificate-on-macos-runners-for-xcode-development#:~:text=To%20use%20your%20certificate%20and,Using%20secrets%20in%20GitHub%20Actions) is useful for managing the OpenAI API key in CI (you’d store it as a secret and inject as env var in the workflow, never exposing it).\n\nBy following this development plan and leveraging the above resources, developers can confidently build and extend **Personal Toolbox** into a robust, secure, and easily extensible macOS utility application. Each tool module remains self-contained yet seamlessly integrated into the SwiftUI interface, providing a clean user experience and maintainable codebase.\n\n---\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nwould it be easier just making each of these tools an executable that the swift UI GUI just \"executes?\"\n\n---\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nYes, absolutely. In many cases it is simpler and more maintainable to build each tool as its own executable (or script) and have your SwiftUI GUI simply launch these executables using the Process API. This approach offers several advantages:\n\n* **Separation of Concerns:** Each tool remains independent. You can develop, test, and update them separately without impacting the GUI.\n* **Language Flexibility:** You’re free to write your tools in the language most appropriate for the task (Python, Node, Shell, etc.) without mixing them with Swift code.\n* **Modularity:** The SwiftUI app acts as a lightweight wrapper that simply discovers available executables (or uses a configuration file) and executes them when a button is pressed.\n* **Ease of Debugging:** You can debug the individual tools independently using your language-specific tools, and then simply integrate the results into your GUI.\n* **Future Scalability:** When you decide to add more tools (or switch some to remote execution), you already have a clear boundary between the GUI and the actual functionality.\n\nThe main downside might be that you have to manage inter-process communication (i.e. passing inputs, capturing outputs, and error handling), but Swift’s Process API is quite capable of handling this with techniques like piping output and asynchronous execution.\nOverall, yes—it is often easier and more straightforward to treat each tool as a separate executable, and have your SwiftUI GUI just execute them as needed.\n\n---\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nlet's do that.  can you show me the swift code and project structure for implementing this GUI?\n\n---\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nBelow is one way to structure your project and Swift code so that the SwiftUI GUI simply executes external tool executables.\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nPersonalToolbox/\n├── PersonalToolboxApp.swift         // App entry point\n├── ContentView.swift                // Main SwiftUI view with buttons\n├── Models/\n│   └── Tool.swift                   // Model representing a tool (name, executable, args, etc.)\n├── Resources/\n│   └── Tools/                       // Folder containing external tool scripts\n│       ├── img2markdown.py        // Python script for Image-to-Markdown\n│       └── daychars.js            // Node.js script for Day/Time Characters\n└── ToolsConfig.json (optional)      // Optional JSON file to dynamically load tool definitions\n```\n\nIn this design, each tool is a standalone executable (script or binary) in the **Resources/Tools/** folder. The SwiftUI app loads the list of available tools (either hardcoded in code or via a configuration file) and displays a button for each. When the user taps a button, the app uses Swift’s `Process` API to execute the tool.\n\n## Sample Swift Code\n\n### 1. **Tool Model** (`Models/Tool.swift`)\n\nThis model defines what a tool is. You can add properties as needed (e.g., working directory, tool type).\n\n```\nimport Foundation\n\nstruct Tool: Identifiable, Decodable {\n    var id = UUID()\n    let name: String\n    let executable: String    // e.g., \"/usr/bin/env\"\n    let arguments: [String]   // e.g., [\"python3\", \"<path-to-script>\"]\n    let workingDirectory: String?  // optional directory if needed\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Main Content View** (`ContentView.swift`)\n\nThis view displays a list of tool buttons. When a button is tapped, it launches the tool asynchronously using `Process`. It also displays the tool’s output.\n\n```\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    @State private var outputText = \"\"\n    \n    // Example tools: adjust paths using Bundle.main.path(forResource:) so that the app finds the scripts in the bundle.\n    let tools: [Tool] = [\n        Tool(\n            name: \"Image to Markdown\",\n            executable: \"/usr/bin/env\",\n            arguments: [\n                \"python3\",\n                Bundle.main.path(forResource: \"img2markdown\", ofType: \"py\", inDirectory: \"Tools\") ?? \"\"\n            ],\n            workingDirectory: nil\n        ),\n        Tool(\n            name: \"Day/Time Characters\",\n            executable: \"/usr/bin/env\",\n            arguments: [\n                \"node\",\n                Bundle.main.path(forResource: \"daychars\", ofType: \"js\", inDirectory: \"Tools\") ?? \"\"\n            ],\n            workingDirectory: nil\n        )\n    ]\n    \n    var body: some View {\n        NavigationView {\n            List(tools) { tool in\n                Button(action: {\n                    runTool(tool)\n                }) {\n                    Text(tool.name)\n                        .font(.headline)\n                        .padding(.vertical, 8)\n                }\n            }\n            .navigationTitle(\"Personal Toolbox\")\n        }\n        .overlay(\n            VStack {\n                Spacer()\n                if !outputText.isEmpty {\n                    ScrollView {\n                        Text(outputText)\n                            .font(.system(.body, design: .monospaced))\n                            .padding()\n                    }\n                    .frame(height: 200)\n                    .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.2))\n                }\n            }\n        )\n    }\n    \n    /// Runs the selected tool using the Process API.\n    func runTool(_ tool: Tool) {\n        outputText = \"Running \(tool.name)...\n\"\n        \n        let process = Process()\n        process.executableURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: tool.executable)\n        process.arguments = tool.arguments\n        \n        if let workingDir = tool.workingDirectory {\n            process.currentDirectoryURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: workingDir)\n        }\n        \n        let pipe = Pipe()\n        process.standardOutput = pipe\n        process.standardError = pipe\n        \n        do {\n            try process.run()\n        } catch {\n            outputText += \"Failed to run \(tool.name): \(error.localizedDescription)\"\n            return\n        }\n        \n        // Capture output asynchronously\n        pipe.fileHandleForReading.readabilityHandler = { handle in\n            let data = handle.availableData\n            if data.isEmpty { return }\n            if let output = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {\n                DispatchQueue.main.async {\n                    self.outputText += output\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        \n        process.terminationHandler = { process in\n            DispatchQueue.main.async {\n                self.outputText += \"\n\(tool.name) finished with status \(process.terminationStatus)\"\n                // Remove the handler when done\n                pipe.fileHandleForReading.readabilityHandler = nil\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nstruct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {\n    static var previews: some View {\n        ContentView()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Main App Entry Point** (`PersonalToolboxApp.swift`)\n\nThis file sets up the app’s window and displays the ContentView.\n\n```\nimport SwiftUI\n\n@main\nstruct PersonalToolboxApp: App {\n    var body: some Scene {\n        WindowGroup {\n            ContentView()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n* **Executable Lookup:**\nThe sample code uses `Bundle.main.path(forResource:ofType:inDirectory:)` to locate the external tool scripts within your app bundle. Make sure the files in **Resources/Tools/** are added to your Xcode project and included as “Copy Bundle Resources.”\n* **Process Execution:**\nWhen the user taps a tool’s button, the `runTool(_:)` function creates a `Process` with the specified executable (e.g., `/usr/bin/env`) and arguments (e.g., `[\"python3\", \"/path/to/img2markdown.py\"]`). It sets up a pipe to capture the tool’s output and error streams.\n* **Asynchronous Output Handling:**\nThe code uses a readability handler on the pipe’s file handle so that output is appended to the UI (in the overlay Text view) as it arrives. When the process terminates, the termination handler appends the exit status to the output.\n* **Modularity:**\nEach tool is a self-contained executable. You can update, remove, or add new tools by placing new scripts in **Resources/Tools/** and updating the tools array (or a JSON configuration file if you prefer a dynamic approach).\n\n## Next Steps and Enhancements\n\n* **Dynamic Tool Loading:**\nInstead of hardcoding the `tools` array, you could load tool definitions from an external JSON file (e.g., `ToolsConfig.json`). This lets you add or remove tools without modifying the Swift code.\n* **Secure API Key Management:**\nFor tools requiring sensitive keys (like `img2markdown.py`), you can retrieve the API key from the macOS Keychain and pass it via the process’s environment dictionary (e.g., `process.environment = [\"OPENAI_API_KEY\": apiKey]`).\n* **Error Handling & UI Improvements:**\nEnhance error handling and consider displaying output in a dedicated view with options to clear or copy the text.\n* **Unit Testing:**\nAdd Swift unit tests for your process-launching logic and any dynamic tool-loading code. For the external tools, consider writing tests in their respective languages (e.g., Python’s unittest, Node’s Mocha/Jest).\n\nThis setup lets your SwiftUI GUI remain simple—a dedicated launcher that executes external tool executables—while keeping the code modular, testable, and easy to extend.\n\n---\n\n"
